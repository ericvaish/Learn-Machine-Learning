Output of a given step is provided as the input of the next step.
Helps with problems like:
P : complete : "My name is" ?
S ; As we receive previous outputs as input, its easier for RNN to find the solution "is"

This leads to:
Suffers from dependency problem.


## LSTM : Long Short Term Memory , solves this problem.

- Used for sequence detection and long term dependency data.
