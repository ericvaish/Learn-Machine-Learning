Forget Gate : Defines the state information thats stored can be forgotten. Meaning its no longer contextually relevant.

Input Gate : Defines the new information to be added or updated to the working storage state information.

Output Gate : Out of all information stored in the state information, what information should we output.

(0-1) : Each gate is assigmed a number between 0 and 1.
0 : Gate is closed. Nothing gets through.
1 ; Gate is open. Everything gets through

eg.
1. Forget everything
2. Forget a little bit
3. Add everyhthing
4. Add nothing


Use Case:
1. Machine Translation
2. QnA Chatbots
