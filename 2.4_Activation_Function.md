## Activation Function
it is a mathematical function applied to a neuron's output to introduce non linearity, enabling the model to learn complex patterns.

1. Linear Activation Functions

f(x) = (x)

**Use Case:** Not commonly used as it dosent introduce non linearity.


2. Non-Linear Activation Functions


(i) Sigmoid 
f(x)= 1 / (1+e−x1)​
